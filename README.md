# Brachy's Inventory Tweaks

This is a rewrite of the popular inventory tweaks mod.

### Why?
InventoryTweaks API is very limited. It doesn't work well with modular gui libraries like ModularUI.
### Why rewrite and not just fork?
The code base is utter garbage. It's one of the most disgusting code bases I've ever seen (no offense).

## TODO's

- basic sorting
- advanced sorting of items (name, meta, mod, ore dict, nbt)
- user customizable sort order
- more user customization (like new row between certain sorts)
- swap out broken tools automatically
